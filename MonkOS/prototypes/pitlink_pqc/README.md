# PitLink PQC Prototype Showcase

This directory now ships a lightweight, cross-industry prototype that demonstrates the key ideas behind the **PitLink PQC** priority-aware, quantum-safe data shuttle.  Use it to pitch PitLink in motorsport, autonomous mobility, smart manufacturing, or any future scenario you imagine for TrackShift 2025 showcases and onboarding sessions.

## üéØ Prototype Goals

- Visualise how files are chunked and prioritised (P0 / P1 / P2) across multiple industries
- Show weighted fair queuing (WFQ) combined with earliest-deadline-first (EDF) ordering
- Emulate multi-path delivery across lossy links with forward error correction (FEC)
- Provide concise metrics for delivery time, losses, and recoveries
- Swap scenarios instantly (motorsport, urban mobility, gigafactory) to suit different TrackShift judging rubrics

## üß™ Running the Demo

```bash
cd MonkOS/prototypes/pitlink_pqc
python prototype.py --scenario motorsport
```

Swap the scenario to explore other TrackShift narratives:

```bash
python prototype.py --scenario mobility --seed 42
python prototype.py --scenario manufacturing --priority P1 --size-mb 4
```

Each preset tunes chunk sizes, FEC ratios, and network paths to match a different innovation story. You can further tweak the dictionaries at the top of `prototype.py` to experiment with fresh industries, link conditions, or storytelling angles.

## üìà Example Output

```
=== PitLink PQC Prototype ¬∑ Motorsport ‚Äî Trackside to Factory ===
Simulate a Formula 1 team pushing pit wall strategy files, high-rate telemetry, and bulk video from the circuit to HQ under fickle 5G and satellite conditions.
Available paths:
  ‚Ä¢ Trackside 5G ‚Äî Private mmWave 5G slicing inside the paddock.
  ‚Ä¢ Low-Earth Orbit ‚Äî Starlink backhaul for redundancy when cellular drops off.

Priority lane: P0 ‚Äî Critical race strategy PDFs and control-plane commands.
Chunk size: 32768 bytes ‚Äî data chunks: 64, parity chunks: 30

[Scheduler] Batch 01 ‚Üí 11 chunks after WFQ+EDF

[Scheduler] Batch 02 ‚Üí 9 chunks after WFQ+EDF
...
Summary: delivered 58/64 data chunks
Parity delivered: 24, lost: 6
Recovered via FEC: 6, unrecovered losses: 0
Total simulated time: 5.73s
Effective success ratio: 100.0%
Result: SLA met ‚Äî all critical data reconstructed
Race control receives every delta before the pit wall freeze ‚Äî mission accomplished.
```

Use the `--verbose` flag for more detailed logs:

```bash
python prototype.py --verbose
```

## üß≠ Scenario Presets

| Scenario (`--scenario`) | Narrative | P0 Focus | Representative Links |
|-------------------------|-----------|----------|-----------------------|
| `motorsport` | Trackside ‚ûú factory race strategy hand-offs | Strategy delta PDFs & control-plane commands | Trackside 5G ¬∑ LEO backhaul |
| `mobility` | Autonomous robo-taxi fleet orchestration | Safety kernel hotfixes and emergency stops | C-V2X 5G ¬∑ Edge mesh ¬∑ Satellite |
| `manufacturing` | Battery gigafactory & robotics operations | Safety interlocks and compliance patches | Fiber TSN ¬∑ Industrial 5G ¬∑ LoRa OT |

All scenarios share the same PitLink pipeline ‚Äî chunking, PQC, WFQ+EDF, FEC ‚Äî but their chunk sizes, FEC ratios, weights, and storytelling notes are tuned to the domain. Extend the `SCENARIOS` dictionary in `prototype.py` to create additional industry lenses (telehealth, disaster response, climate monitoring, etc.).

The chart highlights where the scenario preset hooks into the pipeline (priority tuning, path definitions, narrative cues) before the shared PitLink delivery flow takes over.

## üåê Showcase Website

Need a quick way to impress TrackShift judges without running the Python simulator live?  Open the static showcase site shipped in
`web/`:

```bash
cd MonkOS/prototypes/pitlink_pqc/web
python -m http.server 8000  # optional; or just open index.html in a browser
```

The page includes:

- A **scenario switcher** that retells PitLink for motorsport, autonomous mobility, and gigafactory manufacturing.
- A **priority barcode** visualiser that adapts chunk counts, latency profiles, and recovery messaging per scenario.
- All eight **mermaid diagrams** from the TrackShift brief, ready to export as PNGs.
- A TrackShift-themed hero layout with dynamic metrics that refresh when you pivot industries.

The visualiser runs entirely client-side (vanilla JS + mermaid) so it works offline after a single load.

### üì§ Push Your Changes to GitHub

Ready to publish the latest simulator updates, flow chart, and showcase assets?  Commit locally and push them to your fork:

```bash
git checkout work        # or your feature branch
git status               # review changes
git add MonkOS/prototypes/pitlink_pqc
git commit -m "Refine PitLink showcase and docs"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>.git  # first time only
git push -u origin work  # push your branch
```

Open a pull request on GitHub if you want collaborators to review the updates before merging into `main`.

### üöÄ Deploying to GitHub Pages for Free

Want to share the showcase without provisioning servers? GitHub Pages can host the static site straight from this repository:

1. **Prepare the `gh-pages` branch.** From the repository root run:
   ```bash
   git subtree split --prefix MonkOS/prototypes/pitlink_pqc/web -b gh-pages
   git push origin gh-pages
   ```
   This extracts the `web/` folder and makes it the root of a dedicated `gh-pages` branch.
2. **Enable GitHub Pages.** In the GitHub UI open **Settings ‚Üí Pages**, select the **gh-pages** branch with the **/(root)** folder, and click **Save**.
3. **Wait for the deploy (‚âà1 minute).** Your site will appear at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

Optional polish:

- Update the "View Prototype README" and "Prototype Script" buttons in `index.html` to point at the public GitHub URLs (e.g., `https://github.com/<user>/<repo>/blob/main/...`) so they work from the published site.
- Configure a custom domain from the same **Settings ‚Üí Pages** screen if you own one.

To redeploy after local changes:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git subtree split --prefix MonkOS/prototypes/pitlink_pqc/web -b gh-pages
git push origin gh-pages --force
```

GitHub Pages rebuilds automatically after each push, keeping the TrackShift showcase free to host and easy to share with judges.
